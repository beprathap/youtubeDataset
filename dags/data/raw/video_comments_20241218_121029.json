One manufacturer bungled the vaccine and sent out live viruses to children who had worse side effects of being vaccinated than they would have if they caught the virus on their own. And the oral vaccine that f***ed children in much the same way. We have since corrected the mishap and the vaccine  is regulated and safe, but it can lead to some insight as to why people are afraid of vaccines.",

We all know that most Doctors are way over paid, all they do is hand out prescriptions like candy and not care about actually fixing the issue, it\u2019s just write and prescription, and move on to the next inconvenient patient. It\u2019s like paying $1000 just to have them write us a prescription. Then we have to pay another $1000 for the medicine. It\u2019s the biggest scam, then you\u2019ll need another prescription to combat the side effects from the first prescription, and on and on. This is why the healthcare system is so expensive. These overpriced Doctors want corporate greed because it\u2019s lines their pocket while they do a cushioned job.  All of this happens while our government demonizes natural medicine. And the Biden Harris administration had done nothing about it because guess who their biggest donors are after the weapons manufacturers. All of us liberals got scammed when we voted for those clowns",

The hoops we have to jump through to get that money from the insurance companies is appalling. I would say that it is so bad that there are no ethically sound ABA programs in Texas, because there isn&#39;t a single location that that can afford to pay their RBTs a livable wage.

It&#39;s also important to know that even if exposed, there is a 72-hour window to take PEP (Post Exposure Prophylaxis), which makes HIV far less dangerous than many people believe. I understand that people may be worried about STIs, but it&#39;s crucial to educate, not stigmatize. In the US, the CDC provides a risk factor calculator that shows the risk of HIV from oral sex is equivalent to that of kissing and touching. People raised in my generation, the &#39;80s and &#39;90s, still hold onto a lot of misconceptions that have since been debunked. While it\u2019s true that you can contract gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis through oral sex, treating all STIs the same way only perpetuates stigma.

I fear she has fallen victim to the \u201csex work is empowering\u201d rhetoric. It is not. This is a business built by men for men. She might make a lot of money sure, but at what cost? Doesn\u2019t seem like it was really fulfilling. I think this might have given her a bit of sexual trauma, she talks about having dissociated and feeling guilty, which are trauma responses. I hope, if she was to do this again, she and her team take proper precautions and back check all these men. These men r just lowlife degenerates that will take any opportunity they could get their hands on.. i really do feel for her.",

All of those comments, even those &quot;defending&quot; her were still so full of ignorance and vitriol. SO tired of so-called progressive bigots putting on their red caps to slut shame sex-workers and scare-monger about sex and STD&#39;s - transparently revealing tender spots where they need to work on themselves:<br><br>1) STIs are not different from many other transmittables - most are harmless and go away after some treatment just like any other rash or skin issue.<br>2) Sex is a basic need for all humans as much as our other natural drives. The problem with sex-work is people (like you) standing as a barrier to safety and regulation.<br>3) Your stigma around sex/disease comes from deep-rooted religious ideas around sex as a sin, and STDs as the punishment for that sin.<br>4) A person making their own decisions about their body isn&#39;t disgusting. Making decisions about another person&#39;s body, however...<br><br>Lily is a sex worker and finds her work empowering. The fact that she was shaken and disillusioned after attempting something radical is not a headline. It&#39;s usual. She had an idea of something in her head and the reality was different. That&#39;s a standard human experience. And an invaluable one because she will now be able to speak to those differences and expectations concerning her newfound sexual boundaries and limitations. It turned out to be a bad experience. That doesn&#39;t make anyone an inherent victim or assailant, and so much of this story (&quot;Some men took more than 5 mins and she felt pressured to give them more time&quot;) make so much contextual sense, the amount of sexual ignorance in the responses makes me cringe...<br><br>Sure there was a lot of shortsightedness around Lily&#39;s idea. That does nothing to the credence of sex work as a profession.",

My fianc\u00e9 had to have back surgery when he was only 19 and even after the surgery he would sometimes suffer extreme back pain and other times it would be manageable. The most difficult part though, that i think Luigi struggled with is the fact that a nerve was permanently damaged which affected his ability to achieve and maintain e***tions, which is difficult for any man but even more so for a young man in his prime. Luckily my fianc\u00e9 was still covered under his mother on Medicaid and didn&#39;t have to pay for his surgery. <br><br>I can only imagine how much worse you&#39;d feel if on top of allll of that, we&#39;re talking life long impacts and a reduction in your quality life, your insurance also denies your claim and now you&#39;re stuck with a mountain of debt.

For example, New York City all through the 70s, 80s, and 90s was rampant with violet crimes. I mean, the place was a hell hole and many parts looked like a war zone. (Dont believe me? Watch movies that came out during those 20-30 years that took place there. Or even cartoons, like X-Men, when Cable goes back in time to New York 1997, he thought he didn\u2019t go back in time until he saw kids playing outside. And in his time, New York was the epicenter of the mutant war.) Anyways, when they removed the leaded gasoline, over time the violence slowly began to slow down and almost come to a complete stop. Look how much safer Harlem, The Bronx, Brooklyn is. Another example, in the 90\u2019s New Orleans was deemed the murder capital of the world. And as somebody who\u2019s from there I can tell you, the violence that was prevalent in the 90s compared to now\u2026 it\u2019s night and day. I remembered that the only safe places in the city were the tourist spots, which wasn\u2019t that safe, and now, a white person can be in the 9th ward and as long as they don\u2019t look like a tourist and isn\u2019t flashing cash, they are relatively safe. It\u2019s crazy how much of a difference it has made by removing lead from gasoline.",

        "text": "Please pray for South Korea.\r<br>\r<br>Currently, South Korea is engaged in a battle against pro-communist left-wing factions that operate under the guise of democracy.\r<br>\r<br>A few days ago, President Yun exercised his constitutional authority to declare martial law. However, the National Assembly nullified it through their decision. As a result, President Yun is now facing potential impeachment, charges of treason, and an investigation for alleged illegal actions.\r<br>\r<br>The reason for declaring martial law was to secure evidence from the National Election Commission regarding illegal activities in the last two parliamentary elections and the presidential election.\r<br>Electoral fraud is widespread in South Korea, yet no one can legally investigate the National Election Commission. Martial law was the only means available for the president to launch a legitimate investigation. President Yoon already possessed evidence and information indicating that the Democratic Party&#39;s 192 seats were fraudulently obtained through rigged elections. He intended to use the martial law declaration to investigate this.\r<br>\r<br>The implementation of martial law was peaceful, with no harm caused to anyone, and there was no military interference in the National Assembly\u2019s voting process. This reflects President Yoon\u2019s directive to prioritize public safety. However, the criminal leftist Democratic Party is falsely portraying the president\u2019s legitimate exercise of authority as a national rebellion. Their motive is to prevent exposure of their crimes, given that their majority was obtained through fraudulent elections. They are now intensifying efforts to demonize President Yoon and push for his impeachment.\r<br> It is crucial for you to understand that South Korea is currently heavily left-leaning. The media, influenced by Chinese capital, continuously spreads false propaganda against President Yoon. Martial law is a legal authority the president can exercise during a state of emergency.\r<br>\r<br>Furthermore, the major opposition party, which holds nearly two-thirds of the seats in parliament, is actively working to remove the president. They have slashed critical budgets, raised their own salaries, and increased funding for projects favored by China. They have also attempted to impeach 22 government officials, effectively rendering the president powerless and unable to take meaningful actions.\r<br>\r<br>Conservative citizens in Korea are determined to fight against the pro-communist leftists until the end. Please share this situation with people in the United States and let President Trump know that President Yun is fighting to expose election fraud, just as President Trump did, and will continue to do so until the truth is revealed\r<br>\r<br>Thank you.",

Tons of people break it without even knowing, and ignorance isn&#39;t rlly a legal defense... But the enforcement of the law is where the unfairness is... If people want to go after Hunter Biden then okay, but they should just as well be asking to go after all of these people who smoked marijuana once and then claimed on these papers to have never done marijuana when they&#39;re looking to get a gun... There&#39;s a shit ton of gun owners that should be getting prosecuted alongside Hunter if we want to go after Hunter... But they&#39;re not... Because ppl honestly don&#39;t really care all that much if you did a bit of drugs at some point in your life and then you eventually got a gun after making a false statement about it possibly because you didn&#39;t think it counted or you just forgot about it... It&#39;s not a big deal... Literally the only reason anyone cares is some ppl see it as a way to go after a Biden family member for some legal reason... <br><br>It&#39;s like how at least in Canada it&#39;s quite normal to do 10KMH over the speed limit even if it&#39;s not technically legal... But officers probably won&#39;t care about it all that much... Idk if America has something similar, but like imagine Eric Trump does that and then democrats make it a big news story hammering it in just because he is a Trump family member... When like, a ton of ppl do it, I think a lot of Canadians think you legally can do 10 over the speed limit when it&#39;s more like officers won&#39;t really enforce it if it&#39;s only 10 over generally speaking... Did the person, in this case Eric Trump, hypothetically break the law by going slightly over the speed limit? Yes... Is it kinda fucked if you refuse to let it go until he gets prosecuted over it just because he is related to Donald Trump? Also yes... <br><br>It&#39;s not like murder where it&#39;s going to be an enforced law every time without fail (within the limits of the law to prosecute of course, obviously some legal BS might get a murderer free)",

This Max \u201cmagician\u201d boy or whatever he claims, he was brought on, brought around, or paid to pull rabbits from hats &amp; play psychic with some playing cards. Nobody asked him for some message about decision making. He put HIMSELF in that situation, taking advantage of the apparently biggest streamer\u2019s time &amp; publicity. He\u2019s the one who risked Kai\u2019s stream &amp; his money &amp; anything else so I don\u2019t fault him for first thinking he\u2019ll be punished for the bs stupidity that boy set him up for. He absolutely owes that community &amp; Kai personally an apology. His little video after the fact even admits that he knew what he was doing &amp; yet he rants about decision making. Where was the decision made not to put that man\u2019s career at risk with his stupidity? Absolutely all the blame goes straight to this max boy.",

This isn&#39;t all that unusual for stunt performances, and I think that sometimes gets lost in the controversy of it all. The performer also should also have had numerous disclosures and warnings ready for attendees, because performers can&#39;t just DO THIS legally without the right waivers and warnings. The blame here really is two-fold, regardless of KaiCenet was in on the concept or not, because he had guests that were uncomfortable and viewers who he should have reasonably known would be uncomfortable.

        "text": "Sadly not all humans anymore are capable of this anymore, as society now favors self-oriented people more than community-oriented ones... Rise of machiavellianism and the anti-social traits of sociopathy, narcissism and psychopathy are in all time high due to society failing to uphold to the morals of our society. My theory is that if we subject someone young into situations where they have to survive and build-up themselves alone in a society their whole picture of the positive traits of humanity get skewed and causes them to teach all that negativity to their children as well, while they may have been able to survive and even thrive and build up a hoard of wealth from ground up they may have been still only able to do so through sheer luck and by abusing others and other negative actions, this in turn creates an anti-social tradition to their whole family heritage which is a tragedy on its own but will live on to always make the society a bit colder and anti-social. As generations pass and ideas spread and societal expectation near the natures &quot;everyone-for-themselves&quot;-rules, the benefits of societal hierarchy unravel and eventually a collapse occurs where old system deemed dysfunctional breaks apart... We all need compassion and help in times, we also all need to have courage and sympathy to ask for help and give it when someone needs it, we don&#39;t speak of these aspects of negative humanity as negative traits for nothing as it will cause misery such as depression, breaking up of friend groups, stress in workplace, misery of bullying, substance abuse and distrust in society... We and other compassionate creatures of this world know that the world where strong eat the weak will lead to nothing but misery as one day we all find ourselves being weak. Spread the good and not the bad you have within you despite who you are/were, because perhaps the good you/someone else put into motion ends up being the hand you need in your next life or future.",

There was one scene where a herd of elephants were drinking at an oasis, when suddenly a baby elephant slipped and fell into the mud. This young elephant came from another herd. It didn&#39;t have any familial ties with any of the elephants around, yet when the other elephants saw it sinking in the mud, it was a call to action as their only motivation was to prevent this little elephant from dying. A few of the adults came to its rescue, trying to pull it out of the mud with their trunks. But as it became evident that even a baby elephant weighed a lot, the entire herd got involved and before long they managed to save the young elephant. Attenborough remarked on how elephants understand the concept of death. Some even visit graveyards and interact with the bones of the deceased as it was shown in the documentary.",

So there&#39;s an incentive to be nice and help others so you aren&#39;t ostracized and lose your access to mates.<br><br>Also, Rasp fish live in pairs and if one rasp is too parasitic and scaring away &quot;customer fish&quot;, the other rasp will &quot;break up&quot; and find another rasp to co-op with.<br><br>Finally, altruistic is incentived when resources are abundant enough and competition is rare. Bonobos are some of the most altruistic apes. It stands to reason that they&#39;re environment has more food and almost no competition for that food. Conversely, chimpanzees live in a more food-scarce environment and need to compete with gorillas. So despite bonobos and chimps living across a river from each other, they evolved very different pack structures.",

One problem inevitably occurs once wealth becomes concentrated on a few, i.e., monopolies, oligopolies, etc.; it doesn&#39;t matter who&#39;s the actor, but as soon as the distribution favours the few we tend to get problems of inequality and injustice. In that sense I sceptical of both private AND state control, instead the wider public collectively is more favourable, which would seem much more democratic too. I like to think about media regarding this problem too; private business corporations like CNN, Fox, etc. over time inevitably become untrustworthy and harmful, just the same as state controlled media, and the only somewhat decent thing countering this problem are public broadcasting corporations (and obviously they are not entirely uncriticizable, but they at least tend to be much better than the alternatives). In that light I find it weird that the aspect of redistribution seems to be overlooked, while capitalism is actually a system that inherently favours private business over the public itself.",

People can earn more money each week by having a job. The amount of extra money that someone can receive from their job can be between two times and four times as much as the base amount, meaning that people that work can receive between three times and five times the amount of money in total as someone who doesn\u2019t work. This applies to all jobs, including \u201corganizer\u201d jobs.\r<br>\r<br>There are different job \u201cgroups\u201d that are created to meet the needs of society at any given time. For example, there could be a security job group, a political job group, a transportation job group, etc. Each job group has individual job positions, as well as one organizer. Organizers control everything about the individual jobs in their group. This means that they can create new positions, they decide what qualifications are needed for each position, how long work hours would be for each position, etc. Anyone can choose a job position that they\u2019re interested in, as long as they qualify for it, and anyone can quit their job at any given moment.\r<br>\r<br>The most important position in this system is the \u201cDirector\u201d. The Director is in control of other job groups, and has the ability to create new job groups, abolish old job groups, appoint new organizers into any job group, and fire organizers from any job group. The Director doesn\u2019t have the ability to control any individual job positions inside of groups, but they can give advice to the organizers that they\u2019ve appointed. Keep in mind, if the Director doesn\u2019t like how an organizer is running a group, they can appoint someone else to take their place.\r<br>\r<br> Each year, people will vote for whoever they want to become the Director. Whoever gets the most votes is able to become the Director, but if they decline, then the person with the next amount of votes can take the position. If two people get the same amount of votes and both want the position, then another vote will take place, and people will only be able to vote between the two. If people want to remove the current Director from their position, they can choose to vote \u201cdisapproval\u201d against them. If one half of the population or higher chooses to \u201cdisapprove\u201d of the Director, then that Director will be removed.\r<br>\r<br>Only a single year-long term is allowed for the position of Director, unless they only served a partial term (in this case, serving a partial term does not include getting removed due to disapproval votes). This means that nobody can be voted into the Director position more than two times. But Organizers currently appointed can stay in their position indefinitely, until they either get kicked out by the Director or if they choose to step down.\r<br>\r<br>People will spend the money that they receive on goods, and the money that they spent will then be redistributed. If there is not enough money to redistribute, money can be printed, and the areas where money is printed will need to be monitored to prevent stealing, although this won\u2019t be needed if money is transferred digitally or through credit cards.\r<br>\r<br>Prices of goods can increase or decrease, depending on how much is produced and what the population size is. If there are too few people doing a certain job, the income for the job can be increased, and the income for jobs that are less needed can be decreased. This means that when goods become more expensive, people will want better paying jobs (which will be the more needed jobs), meaning that goods will be produced more efficiently, which decreases their cost.",

They love to point out that with the self driving, there&#39;s not been that many accidents.

They are dangerous and they do not need on the road until they have the framework ready to guarantee that there&#39;ll be way safer than what they are.

So they say we will build a load of very tall scary robots to do the washing up and serve you a drink at the bar!  Really, where are you going to put all the people with no money,  while the robots do their jobs for them????  In 50 years time,  Tesler, Look our Robots have taught people how to serve drinks!!!  Its nice to have dreams but sometyimes a pipe dream should stay in the Pipe.   You comment about the Robots, I do think he actually said that these are people at the moment.  No way would I have one of these things sitting in my house. I love technology and design but lets do some stuff that actually helps people first! I have just bought a Manual CX5 and I love it.  I didn&#39;t buy an automatic because I don&#39;t like how they feel, or that you don&#39;t feel in full control, especially as you are setting off - or parking. You know what would be great!!

        "text": "It\u2019s astonishing how long Apple has been neglecting the Slovenian language. Whether this is intentional or simply due to a lack of awareness is unclear. Slovenia might be a small country, but it boasts several globally recognized individuals. For instance, Luka Don\u010di\u0107, an NBA All-Star for the Dallas Mavericks, cannot use an iPhone in his native language. Similarly, Primo\u017e Rogli\u010d, an Olympic gold medalist cyclist, and Goran Dragi\u0107, an NBA player, face the same issue. Even Melania Trump, the former First Lady of the United States and wife of Donald Trump, cannot use an iPhone or macOS in Slovenian.<br>While everyone is talking about AI, I believe Apple devices should first learn the Slovenian language; otherwise, AI would be extremely limited.",

        "text": "Artist here. I have been waiting for Apple to add hover and barrel roll rotation since the very first iPad. The only other stylus that could do it was the Wacom Art Pen, which they discontinued earlier this year. It makes a huge difference for artists used to traditional media, so honestly those things on their own are worth the upgrade.<br><br>I am disappointed that there is still no eraser though. I know they added features to swap tools, but it\u2019s not the same. The eraser is fast and intuitive and eventually they need to break down and add it. I\u2019d prefer that over haptics any day. Wacom is still superior in that way, plus no charging necessary so they can create a comfortable grip, unlike Apple Pencil with its flat edge that is so uncomfortable to hold long term. Apple still needs to make better tips that are narrower, but they are steadily narrowing the gap which is nice to see.<br><br>One thing I\u2019d be curious about for the matte screen texture is durability because that texture is much better to draw on. Wacom uses textured screens specifically to make drawing feel more intuitive. I have to add a PaperFeel screen protector to my iPad to get a similar experience, so I\u2019m wondering if this is another feature that was intended for artists but marketed to the masses as being anti-glare to justify the cost of development. If it can hold up against scratches well, then I would go matte every time right from the start to avoid bubbles in screen protectors. That would explain why it\u2019s only on the higher end models since they know their artist audience will want it. <br><br>Procreate for painting and Nomad for 3D modeling are still some of the best software on the iPad and in many cases can outperform full computer software, so they really needed their hardware to catch up. From my perspective, this feels like a long time in the making. It certainly isn\u2019t going to appeal to everyone, but it\u2019s not supposed to.<br><br>I don\u2019t care about thinness though. Honestly it\u2019s awkward to hold and draw on because you feel like it\u2019s going to bend on you. A lot of times I just wanna kick back and draw with it on my lap or stomach, but I feel like I need a lap stand to use it that way which defeats the whole thinness aspect. Better battery life would be preferred.<br><br>As far as where to put the pencil for charging, I think they were attempting to make it feel natural for both right and left-handed users. Putting it in the middle makes it easy to reach regardless of handedness. It\u2019s better than when companies just default to right-handed interfaces. So much of my life has been a struggle because most of the world is engineered for the opposite of what I need. Like it would be nice if Apple let us calibrate touch for lefties. It defaults to what looks right to right-handed users, so I often hit the wrong letters when typing because it\u2019s offset in the opposite direction from what I need. Similar issues pop up with software menus and interfaces. I\u2019d prefer being able to charge to either side\u2014it would store easier in bags and just feel more natural overall\u2014but the current design reduces costs and makes case and stand manufacturing easier, so charging in the middle is a minor complaint all things considered.",

        "text": "Hey all, I&#39;m in the market to upgrade from my early 2015 13 inch macbook pro i5 8g RAM, 256 storage. I tend to take care of my computer and really don&#39;t like change/re-upgrading frequently that much lol (still works fine, just speakers are blown and getting a bit slow, limited storage left etc). I don&#39;t really do any video or photo editing nor gaming; most of my work involves basic laptop stuff (email, youtube, surfing websites, netflix, video conferences), medical stuff (electronic medical records/patient charts) which does involve using secure browsing software etc, research papers/citation mangers (often includes lots of tabs open and split screen needs). I currently tend to bring my laptop to work/travel with me a lot but haven&#39;t noticed the weight of my old macbook pro at all (I&#39;m also a larger individual). While at home I usually use an external mouse and one single external monitor. I think I am between Macbook pro 14in M4 (16 ram, 512 SSD) and the 15 in M3 Air with 16 ram/512 SSD (but also open to other suggestions/comparisons). Obviously I would like the best deal out there but money/saving a few bucks is not my top priority. I keep hearing that I likely don&#39;t need the pro and the air would suffice but I also can&#39;t ignore the seemingly minimal price point difference, better display/speakers and more ports of the macbook pro. Any insight? Thx much!",

I am quite willing to spend a good amount of money on an Apple laptop if it is fast enough for video editing, but if it no longer works properly after 2 years due to a defective SSD or RAM, then I cannot repair it myself. This means that I am at the mercy of Apple for the repair of an expensive laptop. That is the dependency that I do not want to hand over. For that much money, I have to be quite sure that I can continue to use the device. A motherboard can always break in a Lenovo or HP laptop, for example, but I can replace the SSD and RAM there and let&#39;s be honest, the thing that broke the most in my work in recent years was the SSD.\r<br>\r<br>That&#39;s the reason I don&#39;t buy an Apple laptop. \r<br>\r<br>Right to repair.",

I just open 3 apps at a time based on my working condition. I heard that macOS ARM processor is highly effective than the intel x86 processor. So it occupies the RAM effectively compared with windows lap RAM. So is 8gb enough ? And i also heard that m2 air ssd speed is really slower than the m1 air ssd because of lack of nano chips in m2 air than the m1 air. So does it really noticeable in daily life tasks ?",

I dont really think a bigger but almost square 1:1 screen is useful. It&#39;s not useful for gaming and videos also wont really be larger in the folded open state as opposed to having a regular phone in landscape mode. As soon as they make a version, which in the folded out state has an aspect ratio close to 16:9 I would consider a foldable phone. Before that, no chance",

I knew about a few of these jobs, one of them in particular because I used to work at a grocery store. The cutting room was located amongst the areas where you&#39;d access the coolers in the back. I couldn&#39;t really tell from clip, but I would assume the person cutting the fruit would be wearing a cutting glove. It&#39;s basically a chainmail glove you wear underneath your working gloves, that&#39;s what we had at the store I used to work at. We didn&#39;t have fruit cutting as a like all day position, in fact most of the positions at the grocery store were interchangeable by everyone. Everyone hired starts at the beginning position, referred to as a courtesy clerk, and from there you move up. This way, in case the store happens to become extremely busy or chaotic (especially helpful during times of crisis) anyone can fill in for any position if need be. I&#39;ll never work at a grocery store again unless I&#39;m desperate lol, retail is just not for me, mainly due to how the customers treat the employees.",

No heat signature, can&#39;t use heat seeking to shoot down. The energy being used seems more undefined physics, Tesla technology (the man not Elon&#39;s.) Explanation prefaces sounds like previous well prepared.  If this is annually repetative, the question on the worldwide web would be, has any other country had a visit from &quot;Drone Santa&quot; annually? Think new info here is being added publicly to add to the diversion. The problem today, is the public worldwide isn&#39;t as gullible as in the past. I guess the only way to stop the public from tracking and asking our freedom of speech questions would be to shut down the cell towers. That would be a bit obvious unless they blame it on the drones. This Administration will not be the ones to classify these objects. The definition will come from a foreign nation, so as not to connect the two. Love warrant BS and blame it on the US citizens. Ask a Constitutional attorney. Thanks Jo.",

        "text": "Back in late 2018 or early 2019, during my senior year of high school, I had an experience I\u2019ll never forget. I have voice recordings from that night, capturing what my friend and I saw.<br><br>We were out on a trail that led to a bench overlooking the small town where we lived. We had gone there to enjoy the sunset and the night sky.<br><br>Just to clarify, I wasn\u2019t on any drugs, so I know some of you might be skeptical.<br><br>As the sun was setting behind us, we were looking out over the town when my friend noticed something unusual over the mountain range in the distance. It was a glowing object, moving down the mountain at a speed much faster than the local passenger planes that typically fly from the nearby county airport. We kept watching, captivated by this strange phenomenon. The mountain was large, and the object was covering a significant distance much more quickly than anything we\u2019d seen before. The sunset sky was a vibrant mix of orange and red, which made the object even more striking.<br><br>Then, without warning, the object suddenly accelerated and disappeared. It was gone in the blink of an eye. My friend immediately jumped up and ran half a mile back to the car. I tried to tell him to stop, but he wouldn\u2019t listen. I was honestly shocked by his reaction\u2014especially since he\u2019s an avid hunter who hikes and camps late at night without fear. He\u2019s not religious, so there was no influence from any sort of supernatural or demonic beliefs. His fear seemed genuine, and that left me wondering what we had just witnessed.",

Interesting person. And I don&#39;t understand why many give Joe grief (usually about conspiracy theories or what not). He is a very intelligent person. The names, books, movies, etc., that he can recall and how much he knows about so many things is impressive. I can&#39;t remember most of what I have just read, let alone names and books. He seems to just want to learn about as much as possible. Conspiracy theories or whatever, he brings things to our attention and asks questions to help him (and us) try to make sense of it. Enjoy listening to him while I work. Keep it up, Joe!",

I love those episodes because they really put the finger on the pulse of regular people everywhere. I would formally like to volunteer myself for the first one, if you decide to do it. I have led a very interesting life. I came from a broken family, to getting in trouble in school, to being sent to juvie, to being involved in a street gangs (stabbings and other violence on a daily basis until I was stabbed and blinded in one eye by a rival with an ice pick) to being an alcoholic, to becoming sober (quit in 2008) to becoming a carpenter and ultimately ending up working as a satellite technician. That&#39;s the long, short version. Tons of things in between. I know you like talking to different types of people and I assure you, I am definitely a different type of person. I&#39;m also a very good conversationalist. You OBVIOUSLY don&#39;t need any suggestions for content and I hope I don&#39;t offend you by my suggestion. <br><br>P.S.

You can have a belief or faith, but to act as if its immutable fact without questioning is just a naive adolescent act. sorry, i know many believe blind faith that things are true, but i don&#39;t buy anything to be 1000% accurate. I have faith and belief, i just don&#39;t have the ability to be so gullable. WHy is it when it comes to faith, humans just dive into it despite the evil acts most religions have done and still do in the name of said faith?

I had friends provide security for the destruction of WMD items while over there. Plus spending 5 years there myself, gives a different perspective too.

This is why removal of lead from fuel resulted in a massive drop in violent crime.  It is also a likely factor in Flint, MI having a violent crime rate 3x higher than the state average.",

Unlike Eve, who was created from Adam\u2019s rib, Lilith was born of the Earth and was a personification of nature and its relationship with man. Lilith thought herself to be equal to Adam, and refused to lie beneath him in bed, insisting they lie as equals side by side. This angered Adam who basically asked God for a divorce so he kicked Lilith out of the Garden of Eden. However, Lilith still loved Adam dearly, and when the Serpent was tricked Eve, Lilith actually tried to stop it. It\u2019s a fascinating story that\u2019s been edited countless times over about 5000 years, only God knows what the original message was.",

The Roman Catholic Church has admitted to leaving books out of the bible, they created the trinity in 326 A.D. during the council of Nicaea,  they tortured countless people, and they have taken the lives of over 100 million people during their rise to power.

I love those episodes because they really put the finger on the pulse of regular people everywhere. I would formally like to volunteer myself for the first one, if you decide to do it. I have led a very interesting life. I came from a broken family, to getting in trouble in school, to being sent to juvie, to being involved in a street gangs (stabbings and other violence on a daily basis until I was stabbed and blinded in one eye by a rival with an ice pick) to being an alcoholic, to becoming sober (quit in 2008) to becoming a carpenter and ultimately ending up working as a satellite technician. That&#39;s the long, short version. Tons of things in between. I know you like talking to different types of people and I assure you, I am definitely a different type of person.

I love those episodes because they really put the finger on the pulse of regular people everywhere. I would formally like to volunteer myself for the first one, if you decide to do it. I have led a very interesting life. I came from a broken family, to getting in trouble in school, to being sent to juvie, to being involved in a street gangs (stabbings and other violence on a daily basis until I was stabbed and blinded in one eye by a rival with an ice pick) to being an alcoholic, to becoming sober (quit in 2008) to becoming a carpenter and ultimately ending up working as a satellite technician. That&#39;s the long, short version. Tons of things in between. I know you like talking to different types of people and I assure you, I am definitely a different type of person. I&#39;m also a very good conversationalist. You OBVIOUSLY don&#39;t need any suggestions for content and I hope I don&#39;t offend you by my suggestion. <br><br>P.S. I&#39;m going to spam this on a few of your videos, just because it&#39;s long and I want to make sure your team sees it lol",

I have led a very interesting life. I came from a broken family, to getting in trouble in school, to being sent to juvie, to being involved in a street gangs (stabbings and other violence on a daily basis until I was stabbed and blinded in one eye by a rival with an ice pick) to being an alcoholic, to becoming sober (quit in 2008) to becoming a carpenter and ultimately ending up working as a satellite technician.
