At 54 years old she decided to show some people that she didn&#39;t learn bullying is not OK and sent out a transphobic hate-tweet.  This was done in the period this 22-year old transwoman had told about the death threats she had been receiving.<br>I still think that this former lawyer had no principles what so ever or decided that the ones she had should go out of the window the moment she saw a capability to join an extreme-right government or at least work towards radicalizing enough to do so (after receiving a knighthood by our King you can just see the tone on her Twitter profile shift towards more radicalized people, it is pretty astonishing to see).<br>Next to that, I can&#39;t help but feel that she felt the need to show toxic femininity: a transwoman managed to reach a position she might have wanted to have herself and thus, this transwoman needed to be thrown under the bus as quickly as possible.  This point to me is driven further home by the fact that she never gave a single F about this beauty pageant until a transwoman won it...<br><br>Oh, she calls herself a feminist, but next to her transphobia already making that impossible, also supports exclusionary, invasive sporting guidelines to &quot;protect women against transwomen&quot;.<br>When I asked her for examples about why this is necessary (since it is not a problem) she couldn&#39;t give them, and only said &quot;The moment free speech starts intersecting principles of other people and science it is important to hold a debate&quot;.<br>Which is the typical extreme-right politicians deflecting all blame, saying human rights are up for debate because some people are deserving of them more than others (Read: extreme-right politicians should have them, and anyone who doesn&#39;t fit their lovely view of society shouldn&#39;t...).  She also failed to mention the science there, she had no sources...<br>But especially the part about free speech is typical: her free speech, or that of other people?  Along with the obvious problem that all extreme-right politicians have with this concept: failing to mention that free speech doesn&#39;t exist without consequences.<br><br>It was not completely surprising to see her get convicted for group discrimination of muslim people.  While she as a former lower was continuously touting her knowledge of the law and mentioning how nuanced she is...<br>Ultraconservative, extreme-right politics is unfortunately contagious...",

The fact that he and his team blurred out the drivers speedometer just shows they knew that it was wrong for him to be driving that fast on a residential street and it&#39;s baffling that they thought it was wise to leave it in the video because even with the speedometers being blurred out people can still work/estimate how fast he was driving because we could hear how many gears he went through, can work out the distance the car travelled in x seconds...<br><br>It&#39;s not like he was driving just a little bit over the speed limit, he was driving A LOT over the speed limit and that is unquestionable unsafe, especially considering it&#39;s also in a school zone! it should be investigated by the local police department and MKBHD should receive a penalty of some sort. I don&#39;t believe a speeding fine is appropriate given that sort of money is nothing to someone like MKHBD. Likewise I don&#39;t believe driving bans for x months does much for most people.<br><br>Therefore I think the penalty should be a requirement for him to take part in a &quot;defensive driving&quot; initiative to learn to improve his driving abilities, understanding of road safety and would be the more humbling option; The police department could encourage him to admit his fuckup, show that he is fully understanding and turn the whole situation into learning experience for not just him but his viewers with them working with both the police &amp; the defensive driving course team to create an educational video with the earnings of that video going towards a road safety organisation.",

He&#39;s been spoiled his whole life and here he&#39;s showing the world he can get away with anything. He may not be this bad guy type however he definitely straddles this &quot;spoiled tech bro&quot; attitude by endangering people in a residential area, shxt he could hit a dog going nearly a hundred mph and still get away with it.

Furthermore, Russia has a historical track record of rigging elections:\r<br>- 2004 Russia rigged the Ukrainian election that eventually led to the invasion of Ukraine \r<br>- 2016 Russia attempted to interfere in the US elections\r<br>- 2020 Russia attempted to interfere in the US elections\r<br>- 2020 and 2024 Belarussian elections were rigged\r<br>- June 2024 Russia successfully rigged the Russian elections\r<br>- October 2024 Russia attempted to rig the Moldovan elections \r<br>- October 2024 Russia successfully rigged the Georgian (country) elections \r<br>- November 2024 Russia attempted to implement a pro-Russian law legalizing Russian investment and land ownership in Abkhazia leading to protestors storming the parliament \r<br>\r<br>so option 3 is Russia rigged the 2024 US elections and for some reason nobody in America (including left leaning pundits) are making a fuss about it\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>TLDR: \r<br>8 million fewer Democratic votes from the 2024 election \r<br>\r<br>[it is important to note that the votes are still being counted - it is also important to note that there are millions of fewer Democratic votes in the most crucial election in US history, but the Republican party did not see a correlation in spike of their numbers....there are millions of fewer Democratic votes. Why?]\r<br>\r<br>If the Democrats are not voting for Trump - then where did the votes go?\r<br>\r<br>What option makes the MOST sense?\r<br>Something does not add up.\r<br>\r<br>Calling it Blue Anon is dismissive. It&#39;s less of a conspiracy when you understand basic geopolitics...\r<br>\r<br>I&#39;m asking why there are 8 million fewer Democratic votes, and the Republicans only saw a spike of 1.8 million...the numbers don&#39;t add up. Something is odd.\r<br>\r<br>The people confidently saying &quot;it is not rigged&quot; can&#39;t point to Abkhazia on a map...how are you going to confidently speak about the state of current geopolitics if your background in geopolitics is woefully insufficient?",

What about after you get arrested, did you know your mug shot can come up online with a quick name search?

She had to quarantine for 3 weeks and have blood tests every day. Luckily, she never ended up testing positive for Ebola itself or Ebola antibodies in her blood and was completely fine.",

I have anemia so my immune system is compromised plus i got off birth control so my hormones are a mess. I went to my gyno and she prescribed a pill and cream. My symptoms went away but they return every month. Im starting to think this is the same yeast infection i got in January and it just hasnt gone away. Im desperate to fix it but i dont think i can unless i regulate my hormones and fix my anemia. Im trying very hard to do so bc i live my life with a chronic yeast infection.",

I already knew that, since that is literally how elections work.&quot; ) and a psychic who is not very convinced of their own beliefs just wouldn&#39;t make much headway against all the non-psychic people with entrenched beliefs of their own out there.

Introduction<br><br>\t\u2022\tReflection on Using the M1 Max MacBook Pro:<br>\t\u2022\tThe presenter has used the M1 Max MacBook Pro as their main machine for the past three years.<br>\t\u2022\tWorkload Description:<br>\t\u2022\tMost work is light (web browsing, emails).<br>\t\u2022\tOccasionally edits videos on the go, where the extra performance and high-quality screen prove essential.<br>\t\u2022\tIf video editing weren\u2019t needed, they would\u2019ve opted for something lighter, like a MacBook Air or Surface Laptop.<br>\t\u2022\tWhy the M4 Max is Tempting:<br>\t\u2022\tThe new M4 Max MacBook Pro includes upgrades in areas that directly affect the presenter\u2019s workflow.<br>\t\u2022\tMarks the first time since M1 Max that an upgrade has been genuinely tempting.<br><br>2. Key Upgrades and Performance<br><br>A. Apple Silicon Evolution<br><br>\t\u2022\tApple Silicon transitioned from Intel chips with M1 being a generational leap.<br>\t\u2022\tSince then, M2, M3, and now M4 have brought incremental but significant upgrades.<br><br>B. Performance Comparisons:<br><br>\t1.\tHardware Improvements:<br>\t\u2022\tM1 Max vs. M4 Max:<br>\t\u2022\t3nm process vs. 5nm process.<br>\t\u2022\t546 GB/s memory bandwidth (M4 Max) vs. 400 GB/s (M1 Max).<br>\t\u2022\tBenchmarks:<br>\t\u2022\t2.2x faster CPU and 1.9x faster GPU performance per Apple\u2019s claims.<br>\t\u2022\tSingle-core Geekbench 6 score: Over 4,000, highest for any Mac.<br>\t\u2022\tMulti-core performance: Tops the charts.<br>\t\u2022\tGPU: Comparable to M2 Ultra, exceeding M1 Max by a wide margin.<br>\t2.\tReal-World Video Editing Workflow:<br>\t\u2022\tTested using Final Cut Pro:<br>\t\u2022\tVideo project included:<br>\t\u2022\t8K RED raw footage.<br>\t\u2022\tGraphics from Snapchat AR glasses.<br>\t\u2022\tAction camera clips.<br>\t\u2022\tThe M4 Max:<br>\t\u2022\tOpened and edited projects faster than any previous machine.<br>\t\u2022\tExported videos 2x faster than M1 Max.<br>\t\u2022\tExample: A 45-second clip with heavy masking and effects:<br>\t\u2022\tM1 Max: 2 minutes, 56 seconds.<br>\t\u2022\tM4 Max: 2 minutes, 13 seconds.<br>\t\u2022\tIntel Xeon Mac Pro: 6 minutes.<br>\t\u2022\tMagnetic Mask Feature in Final Cut Pro 11:<br>\t\u2022\tA new feature leveraging Apple\u2019s neural engine.<br>\t\u2022\tAutomated rotoscoping dramatically reduces time and effort compared to manual processes.<br><br>C. Real-World Use Cases Beyond Video Editing:<br><br>\t\u2022\tPhotography:<br>\t\u2022\tReference to Tyler Stalman\u2019s video, which highlights Lightroom and Resolve performance.<br>\t\u2022\tM4 Max often matches or beats M2 Ultra Mac Studio in photo editing workloads.<br><br>D. Implications for Future Devices:<br><br>\t\u2022\tDesktop Chips (e.g., M4 Ultra) are expected to extend these performance gains.<br>\t\u2022\tThe gap between high-end laptops and desktops continues to narrow.<br><br>3. Design and Display Enhancements<br><br>A. Space Black Finish:<br><br>\t\u2022\tNew Color Option:<br>\t\u2022\tSpace Black is visually striking but prone to fingerprints and wear over time.<br>\t\u2022\tWorkaround: Recommends using skins or cases to avoid smudges and scratches.<br>\t\u2022\tLinks to dbrand Glitch skins for added personality.<br><br>B. Nano-Texture Display:<br><br>\t\u2022\tWhat It Is:<br>\t\u2022\tA $100 matte finish display option, previously seen on Apple\u2019s Pro Display XDR and Studio Display.<br>\t\u2022\tBenefits:<br>\t\u2022\tMinimizes reflections in diverse lighting conditions (office, coffee shop, airplane).<br>\t\u2022\tEnhances usability in bright environments.<br>\t\u2022\tImproved Durability:<br>\t\u2022\tPast nano-texture displays required delicate cleaning, but this iteration seems more resilient.<br>\t\u2022\tPersonal Take:<br>\t\u2022\tPresenter calls it a must-have upgrade, emphasizing its transformative impact on the viewing experience.<br><br>4. Thunderbolt 5<br><br>\t\u2022\tSignificance:<br>\t\u2022\tNew laptops now feature Thunderbolt 5, which increases bandwidth and I/O speeds.<br>\t\u2022\tAdvantages:<br>\t\u2022\tSupports three 6K displays simultaneously (up from two).<br>\t\u2022\tIdeal for future-proofing as Thunderbolt 5 accessories become more widely available.<br>\t\u2022\tDrawbacks:<br>\t\u2022\tFew accessories currently support Thunderbolt 5, and they tend to be expensive:<br>\t\u2022\tExample: OWC Thunderbolt 5 drive offers 6,000 MB/s read/write speeds but costs $400 for 2TB.<br>\t\u2022\tPersonal Use Case:<br>\t\u2022\tAs a video editor working with large files, the presenter anticipates adopting Thunderbolt 5 accessories as the ecosystem matures.<br><br>5. Smaller Upgrades<br><br>\t\u2022\tBattery Life:<br>\t\u2022\tImproved efficiency from the M4 chip leads to slightly better battery life under light workloads.<br>\t\u2022\tCenter Stage Webcam:<br>\t\u2022\tFeatures an ultra-wide lens that can track the user\u2019s movement, improving video call quality.<br>\t\u2022\tDisplay Brightness:<br>\t\u2022\tHigher SDR brightness (1,000 nits vs. ~500-600 nits previously), improving readability in well-lit environments.<br>\t\u2022\tQuantum Dot Technology:<br>\t\u2022\tApple quietly introduced quantum dot displays, which improve color accuracy and responsiveness.<br><br>6. Verdict<br><br>\t\u2022\tPerformance:<br>\t\u2022\tM4 Max delivers significant speed improvements, especially for intensive tasks like video editing.<br>\t\u2022\tDesign:<br>\t\u2022\tSpace Black is sleek but high-maintenance; nano-texture display is a standout feature.<br>\t\u2022\tPort Upgrades:<br>\t\u2022\tThunderbolt 5 provides a future-proof advantage for professionals handling demanding workflows.<br>\t\u2022\tJustifying the Upgrade:<br>\t\u2022\tThe combined improvements in performance, design, and ports make the M4 Max compelling for users pushing their laptops to the limit.<br>\t\u2022\tFor lighter workloads, older models like the M1 Max remain sufficient.<br><br>7. Conclusion<br><br>\t\u2022\tAcknowledgment of Apple\u2019s Pricing Strategy:<br>\t\u2022\tHighlights Apple\u2019s decision to double base memory across all new Macs to 16GB, making entry-level options more appealing.<br>\t\u2022\tExcitement for Future Updates:<br>\t\u2022\tAnticipates more M4 chip updates across Apple\u2019s lineup, including desktops.<br>\t\u2022\tSign-Off:<br>\t\u2022\t\u201cThanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace.\u201d<br><br>Key Takeaways<br><br>The M4 Max MacBook Pro is a substantial upgrade for professionals, combining blazing-fast performance with thoughtful design enhancements like nano-texture displays and Thunderbolt 5. While users with lighter workloads may not need to upgrade, those working on intensive tasks\u2014especially video editors\u2014can justify the investment thanks to the laptop\u2019s efficiency, power, and future-proofing features.",

        "text": "ChatGPT chronological summary to help people follow along at home for people lost and don\u2019t know understand what their watching lol:<br><br>Chronological Breakdown of the New Mac Mini Video with Detailed Insights<br><br>Introduction: Crazy Tech That Grabs Attention<br><br>\t1.\tOpening Hook:<br>\t\u2022\tThe presenter starts by pointing out that one crazy feature is often enough to capture attention.<br>\t\u2022\tIn this case, the new Mac Mini has not one but three insane features worth discussing.<br>\t2.\tApple\u2019s Recent Updates:<br>\t\u2022\tApple skipped an event in late October, instead opting for a series of press releases to announce updates to their Mac lineup, transitioning to the M4 chip.<br>\t\u2022\tAmong these announcements was the new Mac Mini, which may not get much attention in the broader lineup but deserves recognition for its standout updates.<br><br>Insane Thing #1: The Tiny Form Factor<br><br>\t3.\tPhysical Design:<br>\t\u2022\tThe new Mac Mini\u2019s dimensions are 5 x 5 inches in footprint and just 2 inches tall.<br>\t\u2022\tComparisons to visualize its size:<br>\t\u2022\tSmaller than an R5 camera with a lens.<br>\t\u2022\tSmaller than a roll of duct tape.<br>\t\u2022\tSlightly larger than an iPhone but with the capability of a desktop computer.<br>\t4.\tEngineering Feats:<br>\t\u2022\tApple has a history of prioritizing small form factors, and the Mac Mini pushes these boundaries further.<br>\t\u2022\tIncludes a single fan for cooling and maintains a sleek design.<br>\t5.\tPorts and Usability:<br>\t\u2022\tPorts include:<br>\t\u2022\tGigabit Ethernet (default).<br>\t\u2022\tFull-size HDMI.<br>\t\u2022\t3 Thunderbolt ports at the back.<br>\t\u2022\t2 USB-C 3 ports at the front.<br>\t\u2022\tHeadphone jack.<br>\t\u2022\tMissing features: SD card reader and USB-A ports.<br>\t6.\tThe Power Button Controversy:<br>\t\u2022\tThe power button is oddly placed at the bottom.<br>\t\u2022\tThe presenter humorously speculates about an Apple employee responsible for odd design decisions, likening it to previous quirks like:<br>\t\u2022\tThe iPhone notch.<br>\t\u2022\tThe Magic Mouse charging port location.<br>\t\u2022\tThough impractical, the placement is more of a minor annoyance than a significant flaw.<br>\t7.\tThermal Performance:<br>\t\u2022\tDespite the compact design, thermals are well-managed.<br>\t\u2022\tThe fan only becomes audible under heavy load but remains quiet during regular use.<br><br>Insane Thing #2: Incredible Value for the Base Model<br><br>\t8.\tBase Model Pricing:<br>\t\u2022\tThe base M4 Mac Mini is priced at $599, making it one of the best deals in tech, particularly within Apple\u2019s ecosystem.<br>\t\u2022\tEducation discount reduces the price further to $499.<br>\t9.\tSpecifications:<br>\t\u2022\t16GB of unified memory (doubled from the previous 8GB in the base model).<br>\t\u2022\tM4 chip with:<br>\t\u2022\t10-core CPU.<br>\t\u2022\t10-core GPU.<br>\t\u2022\tBest suited for light to medium tasks:<br>\t\u2022\tWeb browsing, music streaming, coding, and photo editing.<br>\t\u2022\tHandles multitasking exceptionally well but isn\u2019t ideal for graphically intensive gaming or heavy video editing.<br>\t10.\tComparison to the iMac:<br>\t\u2022\tThe refreshed M4 iMac starts at $1,299, but it is essentially the same machine in a different form factor with a non-replaceable display.<br>\t\u2022\tThe Mac Mini allows buyers to use the $700 price difference to choose a monitor of their liking, offering more flexibility.<br>\t11.\tApple\u2019s Pricing Strategy:<br>\t\u2022\tApple employs a price ladder, enticing users to upgrade by offering small but tempting improvements at each tier.<br>\t\u2022\tExample: Upgrading the Mac Mini\u2019s storage to 1TB costs $400, nearly as much as another base Mac Mini.<br><br>Insane Thing #3: The Best Portable Workstation Mac<br><br>\t12.\tMaxed-Out Configuration:<br>\t\u2022\tThe M4 Pro Mac Mini starts at $1,399, making it an affordable alternative to higher-end Macs.<br>\t\u2022\tAdds:<br>\t\u2022\tThunderbolt 5 (supports three 6K displays instead of two with Thunderbolt 4).<br>\t\u2022\tMore power for advanced workflows.<br>\t\u2022\tA viable choice for professionals:<br>\t\u2022\tPerfect for those who travel and need a compact but powerful workstation.<br>\t13.\tPerformance Benchmarks:<br>\t\u2022\tTested with 48GB of memory, the M4 Pro achieves:<br>\t\u2022\tThe highest single-core CPU score of any desktop Mac ever, including the Mac Pro and Mac Studio.<br>\t\u2022\tMulti-core performance that tops Geekbench\u2019s all-time Mac list.<br>\t\u2022\tGPU performance is equivalent to the M1 Max, showcasing how much Apple silicon has improved over generations.<br>\t14.\tComparison to Mac Studio and Mac Pro:<br>\t\u2022\tThe Mac Mini offers unmatched portability while delivering workstation-level performance.<br>\t\u2022\tThe Mac Studio and Mac Pro remain on the M2 generation, making the M4 Pro Mac Mini a more modern and efficient option.<br>\t15.\tApplications for Professionals:<br>\t\u2022\tIdeal for video editors and content creators who need a travel-friendly workstation.<br>\t\u2022\tCompact size allows it to be easily packed in a bag or case.<br><br>Apple\u2019s Legacy with Compact Desktops<br><br>\t16.\tPrevious Attempts at Small Desktops:<br>\t\u2022\tThe trash can Mac Pro aimed to create a workstation-class computer with a single fan but faced thermal limitations with Intel chips.<br>\t\u2022\tSimilarly, the thin Intel i9 MacBook Pros suffered from overheating.<br>\t\u2022\tThe Mac Mini and Mac Studio represent Apple\u2019s successful realization of this vision, enabled by Apple silicon\u2019s efficiency.<br><br>Final Thoughts: Who Was Asking for a Smaller Mac Mini?<br><br>\t17.\tUnnecessary Innovation?:<br>\t\u2022\tThe Mac Mini\u2019s size reduction seems to stem from Apple\u2019s internal ambition rather than customer demand.<br>\t\u2022\tIts tiny footprint feels like the result of Apple\u2019s obsession with compact design, especially within its Spaceship Campus in California.<br>\t18.\tClosing Remarks:<br>\t\u2022\tThe new Mac Mini is a testament to Apple silicon\u2019s capability, blending power, efficiency, and portability.<br>\t\u2022\tIt offers a compelling choice for both casual users and professionals, with the base model being particularly appealing.<br>\t19.\tOutro:<br>\t\u2022\tThe presenter praises Apple\u2019s engineering achievements and teases upcoming videos, encouraging viewers to subscribe.<br>\t\u2022\t\u201cCatch you in the next one, peace.\u201d<br><br>Summary<br><br>The new Mac Mini is redefining desktop computing with its unprecedented compactness, exceptional value, and impressive performance. Whether it\u2019s the base M4 model offering a cost-effective entry into macOS or the M4 Pro variant acting as a portable powerhouse, the Mac Mini is an example of Apple silicon\u2019s transformative potential. Despite quirks like the oddly placed power button, it\u2019s a well-rounded machine that will appeal to both casual users and professionals alike.",

Far less waste of energy and an arm could have adjustments so it can compensate if the vehicle isn&#39;t 100% spot-on over the charging zone.<br><br>Ultimately, the full hands-off self-driving aspect with zero manual controls won&#39;t come to pass for a long time to come yet. Until every single vehicle on the road has full self-driving capability there&#39;s too much risk mixing self-driving with human-operated vehicles. And I really can&#39;t imagine the regulations will change any time soon to allow zero manual control overrides - not even in the next decade or two, let alone handful of years. Commercial passenger planes (like 737s etc) have technically been able to take-off, fly and land entirely autonomously for quite a long time now and yet they STILL all have manual controls and they STILL have the human pilots perform the take-offs and landings because as sophisticated as the computer systems are, they don&#39;t cope with unusual or &quot;new&quot; situations at all (or errors in their software which absolutely can and does happen) and will always &#39;give up&#39; and expect the human to take over. Imagine if that wasn&#39;t even possible cos all the manual controls had been stripped out?!",

        "text": "It\u2019s astonishing how long Apple has been neglecting the Slovenian language. Whether this is intentional or simply due to a lack of awareness is unclear. Slovenia might be a small country, but it boasts several globally recognized individuals. For instance, Luka Don\u010di\u0107, an NBA All-Star for the Dallas Mavericks, cannot use an iPhone in his native language. Similarly, Primo\u017e Rogli\u010d, an Olympic gold medalist cyclist, and Goran Dragi\u0107, an NBA player, face the same issue. Even Melania Trump, the former First Lady of the United States and wife of Donald Trump, cannot use an iPhone or macOS in Slovenian.<br>While everyone is talking about AI, I believe Apple devices should first learn the Slovenian language; otherwise, AI would be extremely limited.",

        "text": "I hate to say this but I lost a lot of respect for Evan Hafer. I am a combat wounded vet and endured a lot of suffering from a near death experience over in Panjwai, Afghanistan. I use to work for his company Black Rifle Coffee Company. There is a lot of click mentality within the company along with fraternization within the ranks. Which makes no sense considering generally ex vets show a lot of camaraderie and empathetic bonding which internally was unheard of for the most part. I worked hard just like I always have and put all my time and effort into the company, only to be laid off after 3 years because of cuts. I get if you gotta adjust according to the economy. But I think his downfall was going public. However, he promised a lot of support and mission values directed to the Veterans,  so having this happen and knowing the internal corruption within the company I no longer support him or his company. I was worked to the bone for only about 15$-18$ an hr and had a lot of mental health issues directly connected to the amount of workload and customers verbal abuse. As if my PTSD and suffering I endured from my overseas tours wasn&#39;t enough it was even worse to find out that an American company who says they support vets disregards and gets rid of that very community. So its seems they only support the vets externally. Many of the non vets (civilians) kept their jobs where over 100s of Veterans were laid off. You cant say you support vets and then work then down to being burnt out to only release them from the company. I had very many friends who were also prior service who were let go. To put a cherry on top our manager who was some college boy with no military experience or leadership experience, who was safeguarded by his sister who was apart of recruiting and was replaced into a position who another vet had, so that vet lost her job. This manager had no clue on how to be a leader and was literally just managing. He lacked the ability to read his employees and have the empathy for tough situations that some of us faced, he was very cold in his demeanor and really only seemed to be concerned about his status. Just saddens me that our country cant even protect the ones who protected them.",

Which means any type of a relationship between a man and a woman is completely prohibited unless they are married. Which naturally leads to men being very horny and fuc*ing the Couch and/or another men. But the fact of the matter is it happens not in a usual basis, especially in a bit more educated and modern areas of Afghanistan like the capital city Kabul. <br>Now there is something called &quot;Bacha Bazi&quot; which means Boys Playing or playing boys, but it&#39;s culturally considered Taboo. From all the people I knew in there (relatives &amp; friends), there was two people who did engage in such activities which is not a lot but also not zero. <br>The act was mostly perpetuated by the powerful meaning Rich and/or in positions of power (army, police, politician). The reason for that is because it was illegal under the law and certainly under Islamic law and the only way you could get away with it was to bribe the officer or be the officer. It was also a sign of showing power, ego. Some people liked to show the responsible personal in the area, other gang leaders, cult members or enemies of one sort or other who is the boss (but I could be wrong about this one). <br>The cult of guys engaging in circular ra*ing of each other though is some thing I have heard for the first time in my life. I would have believed it if it was an Ancient Greek story but not an actual happening in Afghanistan. Even though it sounds bankers I believe there is no shortage of weird stuff going on in the world and it\u2019s most likely true but I have heard of no such thing back there. <br>In one point Joe asks if there is a term for hating Christians like \u201cChristianophobia\u201d and I have got the answer. There is a term and it\u2019s called Muslim. They do hate you guys, like a lot. Which makes me wonder what the hell are the Germans and other European Leaders doing. But of course these weird things happening like Gays for Palestine  is cultural marxism and the Muslims are the oppressed based on that theory cause they rank low on the socio economic status especially compared the the Jews.",

        "text": "Here are the key indicators of corruption within the judicial system influenced by private jails like GEO Group and CoreCivic:\r<br>\r<br>Opacity in Judicial Rulings: If court decisions consistently benefit private prisons without transparent legal or ethical justification, it could imply influence from these companies.\r<br>Increases in Incarceration or Sentence Lengths: Unexplained rises in the number of incarcerations or longer sentences, particularly for lesser offenses, might suggest an effort to maintain high occupancy in private facilities for profit.\r<br>Financial Connections: Judges or judicial employees with financial ties to private prison companies, through investments, campaign donations, or other benefits, can indicate a conflict of interest.\r<br>Legislative Influence: Legislation that appears to favor private prison operations, like mandatory sentencing laws, could be a result of lobbying efforts by these companies.\r<br>Neglect of Rehabilitation: Poor rehabilitation programs, high recidivism, or conditions in private facilities that prioritize profit over prisoner welfare might reflect systemic corruption.\r<br>Reduced Accountability: A decline in oversight or the judicial dismissal of complaints against private prisons can suggest a lack of accountability influenced by corruption.\r<br>Notable Judicial Patterns: Certain judges or courts repeatedly making rulings that benefit private jail operators could be a sign of bias or corruption.\r<br>Internal Reports: Accounts from whistleblowers within the prison system or related agencies can provide direct evidence of corrupt practices.\r<br>Legal Disputes: An abundance of lawsuits against private prisons that are quickly dismissed or not given due consideration might indicate judicial protection of these entities.\r<br>Public and Media Scrutiny: Significant media coverage or public outcry about corruption linked to private prisons should be investigated.\r<br>Economic Dependency: Regions that rely economically on private prisons might face judicial pressure to keep incarceration levels high.\r<br>Political Contributions and Influence: Politicians supported by private prison funds advocating for policies that benefit these facilities could signal corruption.\r<br>\r<br>These signs, when collectively observed, might point to a judicial system swayed by private prison interests. However, confirming corruption requires comprehensive investigation and solid evidence due to the complexity of such systemic issues.",

This is my take on the matter.The Democratic party didn&#39;t worry about Nevada and Virginia because since 2008, they both voted Blue. They same can be said about Rhode Island &amp; New Hampshire. None of these states should be included in the facts. It&#39;s like a loophole, so they can present falsehoods. In fact, all these states supported Democrats by at least +5 up to +27 points.

        "text": "Here are the key indicators of corruption within the judicial system influenced by private jails like GEO Group and CoreCivic:\r<br>\r<br>Opacity in Judicial Rulings: If court decisions consistently benefit private prisons without transparent legal or ethical justification, it could imply influence from these companies.\r<br>Increases in Incarceration or Sentence Lengths: Unexplained rises in the number of incarcerations or longer sentences, particularly for lesser offenses, might suggest an effort to maintain high occupancy in private facilities for profit.\r<br>Financial Connections: Judges or judicial employees with financial ties to private prison companies, through investments, campaign donations, or other benefits, can indicate a conflict of interest.\r<br>Legislative Influence: Legislation that appears to favor private prison operations, like mandatory sentencing laws, could be a result of lobbying efforts by these companies.\r<br>Neglect of Rehabilitation: Poor rehabilitation programs, high recidivism, or conditions in private facilities that prioritize profit over prisoner welfare might reflect systemic corruption.\r<br>Reduced Accountability: A decline in oversight or the judicial dismissal of complaints against private prisons can suggest a lack of accountability influenced by corruption.\r<br>Notable Judicial Patterns: Certain judges or courts repeatedly making rulings that benefit private jail operators could be a sign of bias or corruption.\r<br>Internal Reports: Accounts from whistleblowers within the prison system or related agencies can provide direct evidence of corrupt practices.\r<br>Legal Disputes: An abundance of lawsuits against private prisons that are quickly dismissed or not given due consideration might indicate judicial protection of these entities.\r<br>Public and Media Scrutiny: Significant media coverage or public outcry about corruption linked to private prisons should be investigated.\r<br>Economic Dependency: Regions that rely economically on private prisons might face judicial pressure to keep incarceration levels high.\r<br>Political Contributions and Influence: Politicians supported by private prison funds advocating for policies that benefit these facilities could signal corruption.\r<br>\r<br>These signs, when collectively observed, might point to a judicial system swayed by private prison interests. However, confirming corruption requires comprehensive investigation and solid evidence due to the complexity of such systemic issues.",

I WATCHED FB Live from a 3rd group who wanted to keep anyone from getting beaten up as they had at other Atifa rallies. I thought the &quot;peace keepers&quot; willing to defend innocent attendees from ANY mob aggression spoke about their intentions like VERY FINE PEOPLE, so Trump was correct... there were very fine people in support and opposition of an illegal destruction of historical property. He was saying BOTH people wanting it up and people wanting it down had their well intended (good people) reasons.... BESIDES THE WHITE SUPREMACISTS WHICH HE IMMEDIATELY AND CLEARLY CONDEMNED!! <br><br>Ever since 2016 media has asked him and his many kinds of reps over 100 times if he would denounce the Neo-Nazis he already condemned a dozen times. He answered several times, Kellyanne Conway answered several times, Sarah Huckabee Sanders answered several times, Congresspersons answered several times that he condemned all Neo-Nazi types. Media to THIS YEAR in 2024 CONTINUES this BARAGE AS IF THEY STILL DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT HE SAID... <br><br>It&#39;s 100% diabolical propaganda, which is the tail wagging the dog! Americans who want TRUTH can EASILY FIND IT!!! YOU can EASILY FIND TRUTH by puting in some work!! The first time I saw Obama, I liked his run for POTUS. I researched both McCain and him for 90 hours before voting. I ended up disliking both for their cold past political behavior. I guess Obama thinks we are all still under his spell in 2024, but people are RESEARCHING like I did. People are finally asking for truth rather than propaganda. CSPAN is a good place to look for both sides from Congress! That&#39;s one of my favorite sources. Search history, books, blogs, NOT extremely biased angry Marxist Teachers, 24Hr Commentators, Comedians, Hollywood, and Profs. Go do research or admit you don&#39;t care what&#39;s true... bc The View will NEVER tell you truth.<br><br><br>I watched that speech LIVE. I KNOW that media and Democrats have slandered him for 8 years. Now YOU know the REST of the story. Now you know WHO lies. <br>\ud83e\udd25\ud83e\udd25\ud83e\udd25\ud83e\udd25\ud83e\udd25\ud83e\udd25\ud83e\udd25\ud83e\udd25\ud83e\udd25",

        "text": "Here are the key indicators of corruption within the judicial system influenced by private jails like GEO Group and CoreCivic:\r<br>\r<br>Opacity in Judicial Rulings: If court decisions consistently benefit private prisons without transparent legal or ethical justification, it could imply influence from these companies.\r<br>Increases in Incarceration or Sentence Lengths: Unexplained rises in the number of incarcerations or longer sentences, particularly for lesser offenses, might suggest an effort to maintain high occupancy in private facilities for profit.\r<br>Financial Connections: Judges or judicial employees with financial ties to private prison companies, through investments, campaign donations, or other benefits, can indicate a conflict of interest.\r<br>Legislative Influence: Legislation that appears to favor private prison operations, like mandatory sentencing laws, could be a result of lobbying efforts by these companies.\r<br>Neglect of Rehabilitation: Poor rehabilitation programs, high recidivism, or conditions in private facilities that prioritize profit over prisoner welfare might reflect systemic corruption.\r<br>Reduced Accountability: A decline in oversight or the judicial dismissal of complaints against private prisons can suggest a lack of accountability influenced by corruption.\r<br>Notable Judicial Patterns: Certain judges or courts repeatedly making rulings that benefit private jail operators could be a sign of bias or corruption.\r<br>Internal Reports: Accounts from whistleblowers within the prison system or related agencies can provide direct evidence of corrupt practices.\r<br>Legal Disputes: An abundance of lawsuits against private prisons that are quickly dismissed or not given due consideration might indicate judicial protection of these entities.\r<br>Public and Media Scrutiny: Significant media coverage or public outcry about corruption linked to private prisons should be investigated.\r<br>Economic Dependency: Regions that rely economically on private prisons might face judicial pressure to keep incarceration levels high.\r<br>Political Contributions and Influence: Politicians supported by private prison funds advocating for policies that benefit these facilities could signal corruption.\r<br>\r<br>These signs, when collectively observed, might point to a judicial system swayed by private prison interests. However, confirming corruption requires comprehensive investigation and solid evidence due to the complexity of such systemic issues.",

What exactly do you get out of sticking to one political side and ignoring anything and everything anyone with a difference of an opinion says and only believing in what Rogan or fox news says. Please just look at it from all angles and have an open mind. I don&#39;t love watching political news but you know it gives you an idea of the bigger picture when you&#39;re looking at it from further away. Everybody is concerned about the same things but they make it seem like there&#39;s always a good guy and a bad guy, were not that dumb guys please wake up. Be informed and watch more of the shitty news and the podcaster&#39;s you hate because you&#39;re gonna grow from it. And you know what you might just feel better and more confident in politics when you&#39;re actually invested in what&#39;s happening in the world and advocating for that instead of just turning the other cheek. Its just my opinion that you get a more well rounded view on the world when you engage in politics and really listen to each side with your mind and heart wide open. I don&#39;t have anything against these guys, but i think regardless of political preference, people treat it like a born religion that they cant change or something. Just look into the other side of whatever you believe in is all im saying. You dont lose anything from it. It might upset you or anger you. Thats good. You shouldn&#39;t just be comfortable in politics, the world isnt comfortable. We agree on more then we think everybody. We the people have the power to make a difference but we need to be a family and hear each other out. We shouldn&#39;t all be in this bubble of loyalism to a political party. Its exactly what they want us to do. Each side says the other one is in a bubble and they&#39;re both right. God bless America my wonderful country, i just hope if you see this share this and just encourage your fellow citizens and soldiers to focus on our similarities, we will have differences but we need to talk about it an at least try to understand each other. It might be hard to talk to the other side but thats what they want so please, before its too late, reach out to that friend or family member with a different view and you&#39;ll realize that its all for a good cause in their head but millions of dollars are being spent just to make you think that the way the otherside will handle it is wrong or they wont take action at all. Look at all of our major problems were all concerned about the same things we just go about fixing it in multiple ways and somehow one is wrong and one is right? no, its good to have multiple ideas and to respect them and hear people out. Fuck just please for the love of god get over yourself and try to understand your neighbors. We all should love each other and respect one another, let&#39;s not go back !",

So Here is the thing &quot;THEY&quot; the slave owners, the descendants of slave owners have been in control the WHOLE TIME. They have been manipulating the people for decades. This isn&#39;t a new thing. The ONLY difference now is that &quot;The People&quot; have cell phones,  computers, the net, cameras on the cellphones to document, to prove that this manipulation is happening. For the masses to see well the ones that are willing to see the control that the government has implemented behind your backs even in your faces without you knowing. During Trumps Presidency there where people even police planting evidence causing harm to people vandalising property to insight riot amused my people black people. Our youth were documenting it showing us proving that it wasn&#39;t black people starting the riots. This Government is corrupt to the core. America is now.a beautiful cake with butter cream icing once you cut into the cake you realise it is full of maggots. That is sad. While everyone&#39;s running to get here not realizing or caring that the place has YET to do right by the peoples that built the Republic on the sweat of there back and which whom blood stains the very land this so called government was built. Anyway off the top of my head SMH. I can&#39;t wait for 2025 TRUMP will.make it right. He is the champion of the people. I have seen it.<br><br>Usher in a clear path for the return of the true divine mother. Thank the heavens we as a people saw the TROJAN HORSE my god ( Mrs Harris Emhoff) would have taken us to hell for sure. 75% of us came together and saw the corruption. My hope for is that we can assemble 100 percent and come together as 1 nation that rids it self of its infection and live at peace 2025 and forward. Much love \u2764\u2764",

We can buy us a kilo of minutes. 00967772168484. Have mercy on him. He who is in the show will have mercy on you. He who is in heaven will have mercy on you. Brother. This is my number. The one who can help us. Message me on WhatsApp. We will send it. The full name will transfer us as much as he can. May God reward you well. God knows that the owner ofthe house takes us out in the street in the rain because of... Please see my condition for yourselves, I ask you by God, the Ever-Living, the Ever-Subsisting, to help me, and God is the Great, even at night we cannot sleep from fear. We have neither mattresses nor blankets to keep us warm from the cold. Everything has been drowned by the rain, and we have no one but God. Then you, my brothers, kiss your boots. Do not let me be disappointed. Help us as much as you can. So, do you please us that we live in this place? We are girls and we have no one. Our father died in a car accident. Consider us your daughters and offer and help me as much as you can.
